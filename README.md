# LCA_WIND_DK, life cycle inventories for wind turbines

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that describes the creation of life cycle inventories for wind turbines, using the LCA framework Brightway2.

The functions described have been the basis for the creation of [LCA_WIND_DK](http://viewer.webservice-energy.org/lca-wind-dk/), an interactive map to visualize wind turbines environmental performances in Denmark.
